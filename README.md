# Video Recording Social Platform

Hi, I'm trying out Ember for the first time by making a website where you can post video and comment on that video entirely in video.

Right now I'm focusing on getting video uploading working and testing it. The issue I have right now is I am having trouble figuring out how to test the .catch of a promise.

Here's the test: tests/integration/components/video-upload-test.js

Here's the component: app/components/video-upload.js

Let me know if you have any ideas what I'm doing wrong, or if you have general tips about my approach.
